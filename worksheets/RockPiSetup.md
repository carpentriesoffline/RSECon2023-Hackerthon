# Pebble installation
- Pebble uses Rock Pis from [Raxda](https://rockpi.org/)
- The models used in Pebble are the 4C Plus
- The login node (the red one) should have an sd card in it with the operating system. However, we need to figure out how to boot from either NVMe or USB. We have a 1TB NVMe and a USB caddie.
- Configure the RockPis to use PXE
- Set up the RockPis to work as an HPC, following specs from the poster (and https://carpentriesoffline.org/miniHPC_step_by_step.html)
- Test that this is working with module loads and basic test jobs
- Document the process for reproducibility
